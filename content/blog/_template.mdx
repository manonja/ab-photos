Write your opening paragraph here. This will grab the reader's attention and set the tone for your post.

## Adding a Single Image

![Description of the image](/images/blog/2024/your-image.jpg)

## Creating an Image Gallery

Use this for multiple related images:

<ImageGallery
  columns={2}
  images={[
    { src: "/images/blog/2024/photo-1.jpg", alt: "First photo description" },
    { src: "/images/blog/2024/photo-2.jpg", alt: "Second photo description" },
    { src: "/images/blog/2024/photo-3.jpg", alt: "Third photo description" },
    { src: "/images/blog/2024/photo-4.jpg", alt: "Fourth photo description" }
  ]}
/>

## Adding Quotes

<Quote author="Ansel Adams">
  A photograph is usually looked at - seldom looked into.
</Quote>

## Embedding Videos

<VideoEmbed url="https://vimeo.com/123456789" />

## Text Formatting

You can use standard markdown:

- **Bold text** using double asterisks
- *Italic text* using single asterisks
- [Links](https://example.com) using square brackets
- `inline code` using backticks

### Lists

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this one
3. Are automatically formatted

- Bullet points
- Work the same way
- With hyphens

## Tips for Great Blog Posts

1. Start with a compelling opening
2. Use images to break up text
3. Keep paragraphs short and readable
4. End with a call to action or conclusion

Remember to set `published: true` when you're ready to publish!
