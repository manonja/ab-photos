I'm excited to launch this new blog where I'll be sharing my photography journey, creative process, and stories behind the images. This is a space where I can deepen my relationiship with photography, in a technical, philosophical and conceptual way.


I'll be posting new content here, sharing insights from my work and creative process. Feel free to reach out.
