    <p>I'm excited to launch this new blog where I'll be sharing my photography journey, creative process, and stories behind the images. This is a space where I can deepen my relationship with photography, in a technical, philosophical and conceptual way.</p>
    
    <p>Photography has always been more than just capturing moments for me. It's about understanding light, composition, and the subtle interplay between subject and environment. Through this blog, I hope to share not just the final images, but the thought process and techniques behind them.</p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-normal mt-8 mb-4">What You Can Expect</h2>
    
    <p>In the coming posts, I'll be covering a variety of topics including:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">

      <li>Behind-the-scenes stories from my photo shoots</li>
