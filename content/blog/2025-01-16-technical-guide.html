      <h3 class="text-xl font-normal mb-3">Natural Light</h3>
      
      <p>Natural light, primarily from the sun, offers a dynamic and ever-changing light source that can create stunning, authentic images.</p>
      
      <p><strong class="font-semibold">Golden Hour:</strong> The hour after sunrise and before sunset provides warm, soft light with long shadows that add depth and dimension to photographs.</p>
      
      <p><strong class="font-semibold">Blue Hour:</strong> The period just before sunrise and after sunset offers a unique quality of light with deep blue skies and balanced exposure between ambient and artificial lights.</p>
      
      <p><strong class="font-semibold">Overcast Days:</strong> Cloud cover acts as a natural diffuser, creating soft, even lighting perfect for portraits and minimizing harsh shadows.</p>
      
      <p><strong class="font-semibold">Challenges:</strong> Weather dependency, changing conditions, limited control over direction and intensity.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="space-y-6 text-base leading-normal">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-normal mb-3">Artificial Light</h3>
      
      <p>Artificial lighting provides consistent, controllable illumination that allows photographers to work regardless of time or weather conditions.</p>
      
      <p><strong class="font-semibold">Studio Strobes:</strong> Powerful flash units that provide bright, consistent light with precise control over power output and color temperature.</p>
      
      <p><strong class="font-semibold">Continuous LED:</strong> Modern LED panels offer adjustable color temperature and intensity, making them versatile for both photo and video work.</p>
      
      <p><strong class="font-semibold">Speedlights:</strong> Portable flash units that can be used on or off-camera, perfect for location work and creative lighting setups.</p>
      
      <p><strong class="font-semibold">Advantages:</strong> Complete control, consistency, ability to work anytime, precise shaping of light with modifiers.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-normal mt-8 mb-4">Combining Natural and Artificial Light</h2>
    
    <p>The most compelling images often combine both natural and artificial light sources. This hybrid approach allows you to maintain the authentic feel of natural light while adding control and emphasis where needed.</p>
    
    <p>Key techniques include using fill flash to balance harsh sunlight, adding rim lighting to separate subjects from backgrounds, and matching the color temperature of artificial lights to ambient conditions for seamless integration.</p>
    
    <p>Remember, the best light is the one that serves your creative vision. Whether natural, artificial, or a combination of both, understanding how to see and shape light is what transforms a photograph from a simple record to a work of art.</p>
