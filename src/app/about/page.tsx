                                Anton&apos;s background in computer science, machine learning, and artificial
                                intelligence plays a pivotal role in his artistic process. Anton&apos;s uses medium and large
                                format to capture the grandeur and delicate balance of our world. This fusion of technology and
                                art enables him to play in the intersection of technology, science, and photography.

                                Currently, Anton is engaged in a project initially developed in collaboration with
                                Magnum through their mentorship program. This endeavor maps the artificial light over the
                                Netherlands at night, a visual exploration that seeks to illustrate the hidden aspects of
                                our daily lives.
