Over the span of 20 days, it was just the two of us, immersed in the raw beauty of the Pyrenees. The Pyrenees, especially the HRP, is still a wild and rugged path, where you can walk for hours, sometimes several days, without encountering anyone."

There is a unique fascination in the beauty that emerges when mathematics, human ingenuity, and raw materials converge, producing results that are both functional and visually captivating. Photographing industrial sites is a meditative process for me, a way to connect deeply with the structures and materials. It feels as if I become one with the matter in front of me, experiencing a profound sense of unity and tranquility."
