Going out in the winter months I realized for the first time, the Dutch sky is never really dark. Even compared to mega cities such as New York and Sao Paolo, Amsterdamâ€™s skies where brighter than those cities. Was this just my perception?\n" +

It also has the highest average ALAN of any OECD countries. Measured in radiance (rad), the satellite measured a peak pollution of 10.500 rad close to a village in the center of the Netherlands1. The average in the Netherlands is 7 rad.\n" +

Over the span of 20 days, it was just the two of us, immersed in the raw beauty of the Pyrenees. The Pyrenees, especially the HRP, is still a wild and rugged path, where you can walk for hours, sometimes several days, without encountering anyone. Traveling with analog photography equipment also reminded us of the importance, rarity, and difficulty of slowing down today. The photographic project, combined with the challenging terrain, forced us to go with the elements. This project aims to inspire and invite the viewer to slow down, and through adventure and nature, to reconnect with the wild and healing force within us."
