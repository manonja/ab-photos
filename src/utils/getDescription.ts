Going out in the winter months I realized for the first time, the Dutch sky is never really dark. Even compared to mega cities such as New York and Sao Paolo, Amsterdamâ€™s skies where brighter than those cities. Was this just my perception?\n" +

It also has the highest average ALAN of any OECD countries. Measured in radiance (rad), the satellite measured a peak pollution of 10.500 rad close to a village in the center of the Netherlands1. The average in the Netherlands is 7 rad.\n" +

Over the span of 20 days, it was just the two of us, immersed in the raw beauty of the Pyrenees. The Pyrenees, especially the HRP, is still a wild and rugged path, where you can walk for hours, sometimes several days, without encountering anyone. Traveling with analog photography equipment also reminded us of the importance, rarity, and difficulty of slowing down today. The photographic project, combined with the challenging terrain, forced us to go with the elements. This project aims to inspire and invite the viewer to slow down, and through adventure and nature, to reconnect with the wild and healing force within us."

There is a unique fascination in the beauty that emerges when mathematics, human ingenuity, and raw materials converge, producing results that are both functional and visually captivating. Photographing industrial sites is a meditative process for me, a way to connect deeply with the structures and materials. It feels as if I become one with the matter in front of me, experiencing a profound sense of unity and tranquility. My technique is integral to how I capture the essence of these sites. I use a CAMBO camera, which allows me to represent architecture and industry with unparalleled precision. This specialized equipment enables me to capture perfectly straight lines and avoid any deformations caused by perspective or lenses. By doing so, I ensure that the true form and grandeur of industrial structures are faithfully rendered, preserving their inherent beauty and complexity. Through my lens, I aim to convey the quiet elegance and meticulous craftsmanship that define industrial architecture"
